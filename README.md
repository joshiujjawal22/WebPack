# Webbpack Express App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone your forked repo down to your computer:

```
git clone -- git@github.com:[your-user-name]/Webpack.git --
```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run build-dev``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080(By default server of webpack-dev-server), but you can of course edit that in webpack.dev.js
- I have already edited it to localhost:9000
